All new changes should come from individual feature or bug branches created from develop branch, 
and sub sequent PR will be raised from feature or bug to develop branch. changes can't be directly come on develop or master branch.
"Master" is only for production release and "develop" branch is for testing in dev box, once dev signoff is done then develop branch 
will be moved to master branch
