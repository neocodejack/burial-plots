    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

On top of the emotional impact of the loss itself, the death of a loved one or close friend also means having to negotiate a complex and daunting set of processes.

  <data name="AlthoughCremation" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although cremation is an option, many people, for cultural religious or personal reasons, prefer burial, and this is leading to a situation in which demand outstrips supply and prices rise at more than the rate of inflation every year. As land across the UK is taken up by the need for more housing and infrastructure, local authorities are finding it harder and harder to offer access to burial plots. In some parts of the country provision has all but stopped, whilst many authorities are predicting that access to burial plots will become increasingly scarce in the years to come. Against this backdrop, Burialplots.co.uk is able to offer the reassurance of certainty. Rather than having to wait and hope that a plot will be available when the time comes, our clients can plan ahead with clarity and assurance. Many people take comfort in knowing they have a plot or plots pre-purchased, particularly if they desire a final resting place which is close to members of their family or people with the same religious beliefs. By offering provision above and beyond the traditional funeral director model, we enable our clients to make arrangements such as these, and maximise availability by offering a choice between advance payment and payment plan options.</value>

    <value>Floral Sprays – a floral spray is an arrangement of flowers which can be laid flat upon the lid of the coffin. Sprays can range in size from under a metre to several feet long, and can be made up of whatever flowers you choose. The deceased may have had a favourite flower, or perhaps something as simple as a colour which they particularly liked. Popular choices include roses, lilies and carnations. Most sprays take the form of a simple flattened bouquet, but it is possible to order a spray in the shape of something like a cross.</value>

    <value>Choosing the flowers for a funeral is just one more way of making a personal tribute as part of an event which is all about saying goodbye to someone you love. Whilst a bunch of flowers may seem like a simple thing, the truth of the matter is that a skilled florist can arrange and create a dazzling array of designs able to reflect the person you’re arranging the funeral for. Every arrangement, what’s more, will be utterly unique, dependent upon the flowers which are available at any given time of year, and of the size shape and colour of the individual flowers chosen.</value>

  <data name="Thepositiveaspect" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The positive aspect of this situation is two-fold. In the first instance, having practical matters to focus on can sometimes help when you’re dealing with the first impact of bereavement. The legal matters such as dealing with probate or simply registering a death can’t be avoided, whilst planning the funeral can, for some people, feel therapeutic.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Thesecondpositive" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The second positive aspect of the situation is that a lot of help is available. In the first instance family and friends will probably rally round, but there are also agencies and bodies devoted to making bereavement easier to cope with. Burialplots.co.uk is one such port of call. As well as making it easier to find a burial plot in the UK, and providing plots at affordable prices, we bring together the wide range of information needed following bereavement in one easily accessible place.

    <value>Tributes – whilst the floral arrangements described above are similar to those which you may see elsewhere there are certain designs which are particularly suited to funerals. These include small cushions made of flowers, hearts or individual letters which can be used to spell out a name.   A skilled florist will be able to conjure up virtually anything you’d like to see, from a word such as Mum or Dad to an item such as a star, a butterfly or a basketball. The key is to create something which is natural, beautiful and fits with your memories of the person you’re saying goodbye to.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Whensomeone" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When someone close to you dies the emotional impact can be so devastating that coping with the myriad of practical issues thrown up can seem impossible.

  </data>
  <data name="Thematerial" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The material chosen for your memorial will be governed, to a degree, by the regulations of the cemetery in question. The most common materials are granite, marble and stone. Each material has its own qualities; stone often blends seamlessly with the natural environment, white marble, usually imported from Italy, offers a gentler appearance whilst polished black granite offers perhaps the most traditional aesthetic. Your stonemason will talk you through the options available, advising, for example, on the range of colours and finishes on offer and pointing out possible problems such as a marble memorial being marked by leaves dropping from a nearby tree.</value>

  <data name="Therole" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The role which a memorial plays in the grieving process can’t be overstated. Helping to create a permanent physical reminder of the person you’ve lost can provide a source of comfort during the difficult days following their death. Having to select the nature, design and wording of any memorial will allow you to concentrate on your feelings, providing a practical focal point for the huge range of emotions which are bound to be impacting upon you at this time.</value>

  <data name="Theroleofastonemason" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The role of a stonemason is to turn your vision of the kind of memorial you’d like to create for your loved one into a reality. A stonemason will be able to advise, for example, exactly what kind of rules and regulations the cemetery in question applies to memorials. Different cemeteries will have different rules regarding the size, shape and wording of a memorial, as well as factors such as the colour and finish of any stone. Most cemetery memorials come in one of two designs:</value>

Once placed onto the stone, the words you choose will be a permanent record of your feelings and a source of comfort in the future, so it’s vital to say exactly what you wish to say. Some cemeteries have regulations in place regarding the words which can be used, and your stonemason and funeral director will be able to help you here. Regulations aside, however, you’re free to put whatever you like on your memorial. Many people, for example, like to have a copy of a photograph of their loved one included in the memorial whilst the wording, as well as the traditional dates of birth and death, can include things such as quotes from poems, songs or other sources. The key is to write something which captures the person you’ve lost and will provide comfort when you visit the memorial in years to come.</value>

    <value>Your stone mason will offer a selection of lettering styles and fonts to choose from, as well as options such as lead lettering for marble stones and gilded lettering which is particularly effective on polished black granite. Once you’ve made all of these choices, your memorial will be created and put in place, although there may be a delay while the ground around the grave settles.</value>

    <value>A funeral director is the first port of call for most people arranging a funeral. Whilst it’s possible to make the arrangements yourself, and the details on this site will put you in touch with all of the relevant agencies, many people find it comforting to fall back upon the experience of someone who deals with these arrangements for a living.</value>

    <value>Although every funeral is a reflection of the individual who’s been lost and the feelings of those left behind, there are certain aspects which the majority of funerals tend to involve, and links to bodies which provide those services can be found across the site. As well as funeral directors, we provide the general details on aspects such as choosing a coffin, arranging a memorial, booking the cars needed for a funeral, the kind of flowers which you might wish to purchase and the funeral plan options which are available. It may well be the case that the time and trouble involved in arranging the funeral for a loved one leads you to decide that you want to spare those close to you from going through the same process by arranging your own funeral in advance.</value>

We do this, initially, by making it much easier to find and purchase a burial plot in the UK. The existing burial plot market place isn’t working properly, with demand outstripping supply and prices rising ever higher. We’ve utilised the latest technology to make finding a plot in your favoured location quick and simple, and we also offer payment plans to increase flexibility and affordability.</value>

In the first instance we make it much easier to find and purchase a burial plot, whether you need a plot straight away or are planning for the future. The supply of burial plots in the UK is lower than it’s ever been, and we make it easy to find one that’s located exactly where you need it, while our prices are competitive and our payment plan options offer more flexibility. On top of this we’ve pulled together all of the information you’ll need when planning a funeral, from choosing flowers to writing a eulogy and dealing with legal matters. We understand that bereavement can feel like a very lonely place, and we provide a point of contact that’s accessible and comprehensive. From the contact details of organisations which will help you cope with your loss, to information about funeral directors, we provide everything needed to make bereavement at least a little bit easier.</value>

  <data name="HereatBurialplotscouk" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here at Burialplots.co.uk we offer access to the widest possible range of advice and help for people coping with the issue of bereavement. This includes emotional support, practical matters and an affordable, accessible supply of burial plots across the UK. In some cases the deceased may have undertaken a degree of pre-planning where their funeral was concerned, with the aim of sparing their loved ones at least some of the stress and expense involved. Reticence around facing up to matters of mortality mean that this often isn’t the case, however, and the funeral in question has to be arranged from scratch. No matter what the particular circumstances are, there are certain basic steps which generally take place following the death of a person, and after that death has been registered.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Ifyouare" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you are at the Funeral Directors premises, do not be afraid to leave to consider your options</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Inmostcases" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In most cases, the first step in arranging a funeral will be finding a funeral director. Some people may opt for arranging the funeral themselves, due to a wish to be more personally involved, or to save on the costs of the funeral. No matter which course of action you take, the actual details of the funeral service will be entirely in your hands. It should be remembered that this is your chance to mark the loss of a loved one but also to celebrate what they meant to you and to others. This might mean, for example, selecting music which meant a lot to them to be played during the funeral service, or choosing readings of poems or other literature which you know they loved. Don’t feel restricted in your options by a sense of what’s ‘expected’ at a funeral. Different cultures, for example, mark the passing of a loved one in ways which might strike those of us who live in the developed west as being somewhat bizarre; from New Orleans Jazz Funerals to Tibetan ‘sky burial’ and the South Korean option of turning the deceased remains into shiny, colourful beads rather than ashes. In Ghana, meanwhile, people are often buried in so called ‘fantasy coffins’ which are designed and built to represent something which was important in the life of the deceased.  The results resemble parade floats more than traditional coffins, and notable examples include a Mercedes Benz, a light aircraft and a giant chicken.</value>

    <value>In other parts of this site we’ll look at the options which are available in terms of aspects of a funeral such as flowers, memorials, music and transport.

    <value>The funeral you choose following the death of a loved one will be your chance to mark their passing and celebrate their life. Although there are many different aspects involved in arranging a funeral, a lot of people find that the process itself is somewhat therapeutic, offering a degree of ‘closure’ and giving them something to focus their emotions upon in the immediate aftermath of the death.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Thepracticalities" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The practicalities of arranging a funeral can often seem all but overwhelming in the immediate aftermath of a loved one’s death. From the legal issues of registering the death, to making sure that all the relevant people are informed and then dealing with the details of the funeral itself, the need to liaise with a number of differing agencies can be extremely difficult when all you want to think about is the person you’ve just lost.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Thesecondaspectofbereavement" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The second aspect of bereavement, and one which may come as more of a shock, is the sheer number of practical matters which have to be dealt with. In some cases the deceased may have engaged in a degree of pre-planning for their funeral, but this is often not the case, particularly if the death was unexpected. Even pre-planning will leave some aspects of the process, such as registering the death, to be handled after the event, and dealing with the wide range of different bodies involved can seem overwhelming.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Thismeans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This means that they will adhere to very strict codes of practice. Arranging a funeral can be very expensive, and the emotions involved may leave you vulnerable to exploitation. A funeral director who is a member of one of these bodies, for example, will have to provide you with a price list when asked, and you can be certain they will always behave with the utmost tact and sensitivity. The exact role a funeral director will fill varies from case to case, as part of the remit is to respond to the unique needs of each individual client. Amongst the duties which they will generally undertake will be the following:</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Whensomeoneclose" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When someone close to you dies the impact is multi-faceted. The first and most obvious issue which you’ll have to deal with will be the emotions you’ll feel. No two people are exactly the same, and so the grief, anger, sadness and shock will differ from person to person and case to case. The important thing to realise is that there’s no such thing as the ‘right’ way to feel when you lose a loved one, and that the cliché about time being a great healer is actually based on truth. Although it’s difficult to believe in the immediate aftermath of a death, there will come a time when you can look back on the life of that person with joy as well as sadness.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Whilstthedetails" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Whilst the details of the funeral and of the service itself are open to interpretation, there is a set pattern which funerals in the UK generally follow. In most cases the procession will start from the home of the deceased, with the coffin on one car and mourners in another travelling at slow speed to the place where the service is to be held. This is often a religious building such as a church or chapel. The coffin will be placed at the front of the room with the nearest relatives sitting closest to the front. In the case of a burial, the coffin will be taken to the grave after the initial service and a shorter service will then take place as it is lowered into the ground. The order and content of the service is something which the friends and family of the deceased charged with arranging the funeral will decide between themselves. After the funeral, mourners often gather to share refreshments, sometimes at the home of the deceased, sometimes at a location such as function room in a local hotel or pub. In many cases this is the point at which people feel better able to share their memories of the person who has died, and to begin the process of looking back at their life with joy as well as sadness.</value>

    <value>If you use a solicitor to draw up your will, the fee they charge will depend upon the complexity of your estate, but will generally fall somewhere between £100-£200. Shop around for the best deal and make sure that any quote you’re given includes VAT. You should think about what you want to include in the will and who you wish to leave the various assets to before you meet with your solicitor, as this will save time and money. They will explain your options and offer confidential advice, before setting down your wishes in the correct manner. Using a solicitor will mean that mistakes are less likely to be made and that you can seek redress with the solicitors firm or the Legal Ombudsman if mistakes do occurr. It also means that you’ll receive expert advice on complicated aspects of estate management such as Inheritance Tax and trusts. You may also opt to appoint the solicitor who draws up your will to be its’ executor.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Inrecentyears" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In recent years one of the most difficult aspects of arranging a funeral has been finding and purchasing a burial plot. The fact that the supply of viable burial plots within the UK has been running low has been acknowledged for some years now, and with the demand for burials remaining strong, both choice and cost have been adversely affected. Burialplots.co.uk was created to address this need, and to do so in a way which offerss convenience and simplicity. We’ve gathered together a selection of plots located in cemeteries across the UK. By accessing our simple search page you can locate the cemetery of your choice and then view the plots available within that cemetery. Information such as size, type and cost is provided, and you even have the choice of two different payment options; pay in advance or set up a payment plan. We offer the full range of plots, from single plots to companion plots and even plots for burying cremated remains. Over time, we plan to expand our range into every part of the UK, and to arrange provision in our own dedicated cemeteries.</value>

  <data name="Once" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once you’ve found the plot which exactly meets your requirements, you can use the rest of our site to arrange all of the other aspects of a funeral.  From memorial stones and cars to flowers and eulogies, we offer advice and links to all the services needed to pre-plan a funeral in full. Although a funeral director can and will handle all the details – including securing a burial plot – it makes much more sense to pre plan as much of it as possible. Think of pre-planning as the last gift you leave to your loved ones. By purchasing a plot and making arrangements ahead of time you’ll be freeing them from the stress and cost of having to do so whilst coping with losing you. Purchasing a burial plot in advance will deal with one of the trickiest aspects of funeral planning, allowing your nearest and dearest to get on with marking your passing and celebrating your life.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Planningfor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Planning for a funeral is something which people often shy away from, fearing that it may be distressing. The truth of the matter, however, is that people who’ve made arrangements for what will happen in the event of their death generally experience much more peace of mind having done so. After all, nobody wants to think of leaving their loved ones with a financial, emotional and practical burden when they’ve gone. That’s why people write wills and take out life insurance policies. The same forethought can be applied to planning and paying for a funeral, and with the average UK burial funeral now costing £4,136*, anything which can be purchased or planned in advance will help to ease the bereavement process for those left behind.</value>

The main advantages of will writing services are that there are enough of them for you to be able to shop around, and you can therefore be certain to find the best possible price. The disadvantages are that a will writing service will not be able to store your will as safely as a solicitor, and the industry regulation doesn’t offer the same protection as that given to solicitors.

    <value>Here at Burialplots.co.uk we try our best to make the experience of bereavement as stress free as it possibly can be. A large part of that involves providing as much information as possible, all gathered in one place and easily accessed. Just in case we’ve missed anything out, here are a few of the questions people frequently ask when planning or attending a funeral, or dealing with the wider ramifications of the death of a loved one.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Ifyoufeel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you feel the children in question will be able to cope with emotion of the day, then allowing them to attend the funeral will probably help them to deal with the bereavement. It’s important to make sure they know what’s going to happen before the funeral, and to be ready to answers questions and offer comfort on the day itself.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Itistraditional" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is traditional for the funeral procession to leave from the home of the deceased, although it could leave from the home of a close relative. Alternatively, most mourners may opt to meet at the location of the service.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Itstraditional" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s traditional to wear black and dress formally for a funeral, but this is nothing like as strict a rule as it once was. Whilst most of the men attending a funeral are still likely to be wearing a formal suit and tie, people now feel able to dress in a way which, perhaps, reflects the personality of the deceased. The most important thing is to find out what those closest to the deceased would prefer and dress accordingly. If you’re arranging a funeral and would like the standard dress ‘rules’ relaxing, then let your guests know.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Manywillsoften" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many wills often go missing after a death, particularly if the death was unexpected. That’s why it’ so important to store your will safely with a person such as a solicitor. If the will was professionally written, it is possible to search for it through the National Wills Register. If it can’t be found, the normal legal processes will be allowed to take their course.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Publishinganobituary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Publishing an obituary notice in a local or national newspaper is recommended. It will allow people you can’t contact personally to find out about the death and when and where the funeral will be held.

    <value>The decision to see the deceased for one last time at a chapel of rest is a highly personal one. Many people find the peacefulness of the loved one comforting, whilst others may be upset to see how pale they are and how cold to the touch. Whatever your feelings, don’t allow yourself to be pressured into visiting or not visiting. This should be your decision and yours alone.</value>

  <data name="Thepersonresponsible" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The person responsible for the cars will be happy to travel along a specified route and even stop at a place which was special to the deceased. This could be anything from an old home to a school, a sporting venue or even a pub.</value>

    <value>Any worries you might have about your family’s well-being after your death will be greatly alleviated if you take out a life insurance policy. The policy will offer financial protection for your family when you die. The amount of any pay-out and the type of policy taken will vary depending upon exactly what you want the insurance to cover. You may want insurance which covers a mortgage for example, provides for your children as they grow up, leaves an inheritance for other relatives and perhaps covers the cost of a funeral.</value>

  <data name="Arrangingthedetails" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Arranging the details of a funeral can seem like too much to cope with when you’re trying to come to terms with the death of a loved one, but it’s something which simply has to be done. In the first instance there are legal obligations to do things such as register the death and deal with matters such as state benefits and pensions. A second consideration is the fact that planning a funeral can often feel like the very first stage of the process of coming to terms with your loss.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Arrangingthefuneral" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Arranging the funeral of someone close to you is an emotional and practical ordeal. The emotional aspect is something which most people probably expect. Losing a loved one, even if their death follows a long illness, can come as a huge shock to the system. Everyone will respond in different ways, but feelings of grief, numbness, anger and sadness are bound to come to the fore and will make it difficult to start getting to grips with the practical issues involved in bereavement.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="As" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As well as the type of cover you’re seeking, other factors which might impact upon the premiums you have to pay include your age, health, lifestyle and family medical history, as well as things such as dangerous occupations and hobbies.</value>

    <value>Choosing the right life insurance policy will depend upon factors such as the premiums which you wish to pay and the amount of cover you’re seeking. If you want a policy which will cover your mortgage then calculating the amount needed should be fairly simple. If the intention is to provide a regular income for your family after you die, then it will be worthwhile sitting down and calculating existing outgoings in order to come up with a realistic figure for the future. If you’re aged 50 or over and want to take out life insurance to cover funeral costs and leave an inheritance, then the main factor in choosing a policy will be the amount you wish to pay in premiums.</value>

    <value>Choosing a coffin for your loved one’s final resting place may seem like quite a simple choice, but the fact of the matter is that this is part of your chance to say goodbye to them, by selecting a coffin which you think they would like themselves, and which you’re happy to think of them resting in.</value>

    <value>Choosing all of the details of the funeral can be a way of focusing your thoughts on the person you’ve just lost, whilst the funeral itself can act as a major milestone on the road to emerging from the shock of bereavement. The funeral you arrange is the last chance to say goodbye to the person you’ve lost, and the details will provide comfort in the years to come.

    <value>Here at Burialplots.co.uk we realise just how difficult bringing together all of the aspects of a funeral can be, so we’ve done precisely that. Although the primary purpose of our website is to make it easier to find and purchase a burial plot in the UK, we’ve also gathered a host of information and services. We’ve made it easy to access everything from advice on dealing with wills to the contact details of organisations which help with the emotional impact of bereavement. Planning a funeral carefully will help to keep costs down at the same time as ensuring a day which you’ll be able to remember with some happiness as well as grief. Given the cost of the average funeral there’s no need to feel embarrassed about making sure that nobody takes advantage of your vulnerable state by charging more than they should.

  <data name="Inside" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Inside, the coffin will be lined, usually in white and with materials such as taffeta, lace and satin. Some interiors are quilted and include a small cushion, something which comes as particular comfort to people who opt to view the body of the deceased in the coffin before burial. You may also opt to place some objects inside the coffin to accompany the deceased. This is a completely personal choice, of course, but options include flowers, personal letters, photographs, medals or items of jewellery. Your funeral director or staff at a crematorium will be able to advise if any of the objects you’ve chosen will have to be removed prior to a cremation.</value>

    <value>In the days immediately following a death, dealing with bureaucratic and legal matters might be the last thing on your mind. There are some things which have to be done almost immediately, however, such as registering the death, and the truth is that many people find the wider challenge of arranging a funeral can be somewhat therapeutic.</value>

  <data name="Occasionally" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Occasionally, people ask if it is possible to have the coffin of a loved one transported on an alternative form of transport. This can be arranged in some cases, as when the family of a lorry driver might ask for the truck to be used for one last journey, or when a horse drawn carriage is chosen. As with all aspects of a funeral, the cars you select should be chosen to suit your needs and the funeral you’d like to experience. If you’re having any kind of difficulty doing that, then please contact us via email at (Email) or by phoning 0100 000 0000.</value>

    <value>The host of bureaucratic necessities following a death can feel intrusive, but many people welcome the focus which having to perform simple if fairly mundane tasks can help to bring. The details of arranging a funeral, on the other hand, offer the chance to focus your thoughts upon the person you’ve just lost, and arrange a final goodbye which is fitting.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Theinitial" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The initial choice to make when choosing a coffin is the appearance of the outside of the coffin. Most traditional coffins are wooden in appearance and the first thing to choose is the type of wood. Options such as oak, mahogany, teak and walnut offer different tones and shades of warmth, whilst the additions it is possible to include make it possible to personalise the coffin you’ve selected. These additions include handles, ranging from minimalist and modern to ornate antique versions, and panels, whether plain or embossed and carved with imagery. The coffin will also feature a nameplate, and it is possible to have other symbols attached to the outer casing. It’s also possible to have larger, heavier coffins constructed from steel, though it should be noted that these, and certain wooden coffins, may not be suitable for cremation.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Thenumber" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The number of cars you’ll need for your funeral will depend upon the number of guests and how many of those guests will need transporting to and from the venue for the service itself. Initially, you’ll need a hearse which can transport the coffin from the funeral home, or the home of the deceased, and limousines to transport what are generally known as the chief mourners. Taking a limousine in this manner will allow those closest to the deceased to travel in extreme comfort, without having to worry about driving or parking. Extra limousines can be hired if you want more of your guests to be driven to the funeral, and the drivers will be happy to take a specified route if you’d like to drive past a certain spot. You may want to stop at a beauty spot which the deceased loved, or pause outside the stadium of the football team they supported, for example.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Thetime" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The time and effort you put into arranging a funeral can often pay dividends in the long run, as you’re able to look back at an occasion which you can genuinely feel celebrated the life of the person you’ve lost at the same time as marking their passing.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="thistype" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>this type of policy pays out to your dependants no matter when you die, and is the most expensive type of life insurance.</value>

Although the emotional impact of bereavement is all but impossible to avoid, the practical and financial issues can be alleviated with sufficient forethought.</value>
