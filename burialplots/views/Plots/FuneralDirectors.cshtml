                                    <p>The practicalities of arranging a funeral can often seem all but overwhelming in the immediate aftermath of a loved one’s death. From the legal issues of registering the death, to making sure that all the relevant people are informed and then dealing with the details of the funeral itself, the need to liaise with a number of differing agencies can be extremely difficult when all you want to think about is the person you’ve just lost.</p>
                                    <p>Burialplots.co.uk was created, at least in part, to make this process simpler. In the first instance we make it much easier to find and purchase a burial plot, whether you need a plot straight away or are planning for the future. The supply of burial plots in the UK is lower than it’s ever been, and we make it easy to find one that’s located exactly where you need it, while our prices are competitive and our payment plan options offer more flexibility. On top of this we’ve pulled together all of the information you’ll need when planning a funeral, from choosing flowers to writing a eulogy and dealing with legal matters. We understand that bereavement can feel like a very lonely place, and we provide a point of contact that’s accessible and comprehensive. From the contact details of organisations which will help you cope with your loss, to information about funeral directors, we provide everything needed to make bereavement at least a little bit easier. </p>

                                <h2 class="underline">Funeral Directors</h2>
                                <div class="padding-left">
                                    <p>A funeral director is the first port of call for most people arranging a funeral. Whilst it’s possible to make the arrangements yourself, and the details on this site will put you in touch with all of the relevant agencies, many people find it comforting to fall back upon the experience of someone who deals with these arrangements for a living.</p>
                                    <p>For your own sense of well-being it’s important to choose a funeral director who is a member of one of the following bodies:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>National Association of Funeral Directors</li>
                                        <li>National Federation of Funeral Directors</li>
                                        <li>Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>This means that they will adhere to very strict codes of practice. Arranging a funeral can be very expensive, and the emotions involved may leave you vulnerable to exploitation. A funeral director who is a member of one of these bodies, for example, will have to provide you with a price list when asked, and you can be certain they will always behave with the utmost tact and sensitivity. The exact role a funeral director will fill varies from case to case, as part of the remit is to respond to the unique needs of each individual client. Amongst the duties which they will generally undertake will be the following:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Moving the deceased to the funeral home from the hospital, or helping to make arrangements if you wish them to stay at home before the funeral</li>
                                        <li>Making it possible for family members and others to view the deceased before burial if desired</li>
                                        <li>Placing announcements in local or national newspapers or any online equivalent needed</li>
                                        <li>Dealing with paperwork</li>
                                        <li>Helping you to choose a suitable coffin</li>
                                        <li>Helping to arrange the details of the funeral such as musical requests, printing an order of service, ordering flowers and looking after any flowers that are delivered directly to the funeral home</li>
                                        <li>Organising any collection of charity donations in place of flowers </li>
                                        <li>Helping to arrange the venue and catering for any gathering taking place after the funeral</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>No matter how grateful you may be for the help a funeral director offers, always remember that they are charging for their services and, difficult though it may be, you have to treat your dealings as a financial transaction. As for quotes throughout and, if need be, get quotes from more than one company. As long as all of the companies are members of the associations previously mentioned, you’ll be guaranteed certain minimum standards, and you shouldn’t let the fact that you’d like to deal with these issues as quickly as possible allow you to be taken advantage of. If you’d like to know more about arranging a funeral, or what you should expect from a funeral director, please contact us at (Email) or call our team on 0100 000 000.</p>
                                    <p>When choosing a funeral director:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Ask for a detailed description of costs when getting a quote</li>
                                        <li>When asking for a telephone quote make sure that it is also put in writing</li>
                                        <li>Be sure to get quotes from more than one company and find out if he/she is a member of any of the trade associations</li>
                                        <li>If you are at the Funeral Directors premises, do not be afraid to leave to consider your options</li>
                                        <li>Remember that just because a firm has been there for many years it does not mean that it is still Family owned. If this is important to you ask who is the owner - even ask to meet him or her! A Family owned firm will reflect its owner</li>
                                        <li>Funeral Directors are amongst the most open professionals. They are usually entrenched in the local community. You can talk openly about the funeral arrangements you want to make.</li>
                                    </ul>
