                        <div class="padding-left">
                            <p>Whilst every individual will deal with the loss of a loved one in their own personal manner, one thing which many people find comforting is the presence of a lasting memorial to the deceased. The most common form of memorial is probably a headstone at the grave itself, but, circumstances allowing, it can take whatever form you wish it to take. The key to choosing a memorial is selecting something which you’ll be able to visit when you wish to feel closer to the person you’ve lost. Although the deceased is probably in your mind much of the time, the memorial will offer a sanctuary from day to day life and a specific focus for your thoughts, feelings and memories. </p>
                            <p>Burialplots.co.uk was created in order to alleviate the problems which people are encountering more and more often when attempting to purchase a burial plot. Whether the plot in question is required for a loved one who has just passed away, or is being purchased as part of the pre-planning for a funeral, the fact of the matter is that demand is far out-stripping supply in many parts of the country. We’ve applied the latest technology to making it easier to find a burial plot in the location of your choice, and a selection of payment options which offer flexibility and affordability. We’ve also brought together the wide range of help and information needed when some passes away and that includes the range of memorials available. </p>

                        <div class="padding-left">
                            <p>If you opt to choose a traditional headstone as a memorial for the deceased you should find out what regulations the cemetery in question has in place.  There are likely to be rules regarding aspects such as the size and shape of the stone as well as its’ colour and the type of wording allowed.  Please bear in mind, also, that you may have to wait some time after the burial before the stone can be safely put in place. </p>

                        <div class="padding-left">
                            <p>If a headstone isn’t a viable option, or you personally feel that it wouldn’t be appropriate, there is a range of other options which are often available. Many people opt for a simple plaque in a garden of remembrance, or perhaps a plaque on a bench or seat within the garden. Another alternative is to plant a tree or other plant as a living memorial. The options offered by different cemeteries or places of worship will vary and it may be that you opt to have a memorial placed elsewhere. You might choose to remember your loved one by having a memorial such as a plaque, sundial, birdbath or bench put in a place which you know was special to them, and which you can visit when you wish to feel close to them again. Another possibility is to donate in their name to a community building project or organisation which relies upon charitable donations. In many cases, the building in question will mark the gift with an inscribed brick, tile or plaque. </p>

                        <div class="padding-left">
                            <p>As technology advances, more and more people are taking advantage of the fact that it is now possible to create an online memorial. Dedicated memorial websites will allow you to create a home page featuring a picture of the person in question and the words you choose to write about them. The advantage of such a site is that other people can also visit and add their own tributes and memories over time. Different sites offer various options in terms of being able to upload items such as video clips and music and some also have security options allowing you to control and limit availability. For reassurance on the long term viability of your online memorial ask if the site in question has signed up to the voluntary code of conduct known as The Memorial Code.</p>
                            <p>Whatever type of memorial you choose to create in memory of your loved one, you should take your time making the choice and should always feel that you have complete control over the end result. If you’d like to know more about the options on offer then please contact us via email at (Email) or by calling 0100 000 0000.</p>
